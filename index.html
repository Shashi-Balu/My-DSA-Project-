                            Scheduling is mechanism of arranging requests in order to save un-necessary rotations by disk arm and disk pointer.
                            Operating System takes I/O requests from queue and process them one by one. Algorithm used to select which I/O request is going to
                            be selected first is called Disk Scheduling Algorithm.
                            Objective of using Disk Scheduling Algorithm is:

                                <li>It provides better performance compared to the LOOK disk scheduling algorithm.</li>
                                <li>The starvation is avoided in the C-LOOK disk scheduling algorithm.</li>
                                <li>There is minimal waiting time .</li>
                            </ul>
